## Introduction

### **Disclaimer: This is an unofficial version and is not endorsed or affiliated with Alan Becker.**

### **Note: This application is only supported for Windows. macOS and Linux are not supported.**

This is a customised stand-alone app of Kilkakon's Shimeji-ees dedicated towards providing an easy way to download, install and receive updates for Alan Becker's suite of stickfigures to roam around and give you company on your desktop. The animations, behaviours and actions are all created and provided by [**Stickwave/@StickLaserPhase**](https://x.com/StickLaserPhase) (Thank you so much!) with my own little tweaks.

## Installation Guide

### Java Installation

This app requires Java to be installed! You can download Java from the following link: [Java Download](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

### Download Link

Download the installer from the latest release: [**alan-beckers-stickfigures-installer**](https://github.com/Skittlq/alans-beckers-stickfigures-unofficial/releases/latest).

### Installation and Running the Application / Updating the Application.

1. If updating, exit out of the app by either dismissing all stickfigures, or exiting out from the system tray icon.
2. Download the installer.
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. The application will automatically add itself as a shortcut to the Start Menu, Desktop, and will start up automatically when you turn on your computer.

## Future Plans (Ordered in Priority)

- Add Sound Effects (Toggleable).
- Fix Hugging Animation with Hollow Heads.
- Re-animate all sprites. In the process, add extra frames for improved animation fluidity and life, and transitions between actions, fix the hollow head's height and head shape.
- Add ~~victim~~, ~~The Dark Lord~~, King Orange.
- Add new custom interactions such as small hand to hand fights, or weaponed fights.
- Possibly add objects like the couch for them to sit on?
- Unlikely, but maybe add Mercenaries.
- Unlikely, but possibly other side characters like Corn-dog Man.
